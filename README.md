## 🛑 How Malicious Extensions Can Harm Users

Malicious or poorly vetted browser extensions can:

- **Track Browsing Activity:** Log your browsing history, search terms, or visited URLs.
- **Steal Credentials:** Use form injection or keylogging to capture usernames and passwords.
- **Inject Ads or Redirects:** Display unwanted advertisements or redirect to phishing websites.
- **Hijack Sessions:** Access cookies or session data to impersonate logged-in users.
- **Download Malware:** Trigger malicious file downloads or execute scripts on your system.
- **Exploit Permissions:** Abuse elevated permissions (e.g., "read and change all your data") to monitor sensitive information.

Being cautious and reviewing extension behaviour regularly helps protect against these threats.
